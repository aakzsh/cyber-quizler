# Cyber Quizler
In the recent times, the usage of digital devices like mobiles and laptops has skyrocketed. The craze is so much that kids learn to use mobile phones even before learning how to speak properly. Like, we have personally observed kids as young as 18 months using their parents mobile phones, even being able to open specific apps like YouTube. This is just incredible, but also calls for an immediate and worthy action. Cybersecurity and Digital Literacy are very important topics, and one must know the difference between right and wrong. We believe that it is best taught as early as possible, since kids get access to devices so early, why should they wait for like multiple years to learn actual cybersecurity and digital literacy principles. That is our idea behind the game Cyber-Quizler.
